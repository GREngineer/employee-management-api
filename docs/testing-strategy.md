# Testing Strategy for Employee Management API

## Overview
This document outlines the testing approach for the Employee Management API, covering both manual and automated testing strategies to ensure comprehensive coverage of all functionality.

## Testing Layers

### 1. Unit Tests
- **Purpose:** Test individual functions and components in isolation
- **Coverage:** Controllers, validation middleware, utility functions
- **Tools:** Jest, Supertest
- **Scope:** 
  - Employee CRUD operations (createEmployee, updateEmployee, deleteEmployee, getAllEmployees)
  - Skill CRUD operations (createSkill, updateSkill, deleteSkill, getAllSkills)
  - Search functionality (searchEmployeesByName, searchEmployeesBySurname, searchEmployeesBySkill)
  - Validation logic (validateEmployee middleware)

### 2. Integration Tests
- **Purpose:** Test API endpoints and their interactions
- **Coverage:** Complete request-response cycles
- **Tools:** Supertest, Jest
- **Scope:**
  - Employee endpoints (GET /employees, POST /employees, PUT /employees/:id, DELETE /employees/:id)
  - Skill endpoints (GET /skills, POST /skills, PUT /skills/:id, DELETE /skills/:id)
  - Search endpoints (GET /employees/search/name/:name, GET /employees/search/surname/:surname, GET /employees/search/skill/:skill)
  - Error handling scenarios (404, 400, validation errors)

### 3. End-to-End Tests
- **Purpose:** Test complete user workflows
- **Coverage:** Full API functionality
- **Tools:** Supertest, Jest
- **Scope:**
  - Complete employee lifecycle (create → update → search → delete)
  - Complete skill lifecycle (create → update → delete)
  - Search workflows (search by name, surname, skill)
  - Error scenario workflows

## Test Categories

### Functional Testing
- ✅ CRUD operations for employees and skills
- ✅ Search functionality (name, surname, skill)
- ✅ Input validation
- ✅ Error handling (invalid data, not found scenarios)

### Non-Functional Testing
- ⏳ Performance testing (response times for key endpoints)
- ⏳ Security testing (input validation, error handling)

## Test Data Strategy
- **Test Database:** In-memory arrays (same as production for simplicity)
- **Test Data:** Predefined test employees and skills
- **Data Isolation:** Each test uses fresh data to prevent interference
- **Test Data Setup:** Before each test, reset to known state

## Automation Strategy
- **CI/CD Integration:** Tests run on every commit via GitHub Actions
- **Reporting:** Jest coverage reports with detailed metrics
- **Test Execution:** `npm test` for all tests, `npm run test:coverage` for coverage
- **Test Organization:** Separate unit and integration test directories

## Success Criteria
- 90%+ code coverage
- All CRUD operations tested (employees and skills)
- All search functionality tested
- All error scenarios covered
- All validation rules tested
- Tests run in under 30 seconds

## Test File Structure
```
tests/
├── unit/
│   ├── employeeController.test.js
│   ├── skillController.test.js
│   └── validation.test.js
├── integration/
│   ├── employeeRoutes.test.js
│   ├── skillRoutes.test.js
│   └── search.test.js
└── setup/
    └── testData.js
```

## Framework Decisions
- **Jest:** Chosen for comprehensive testing framework with built-in mocking and coverage
- **Supertest:** Chosen for HTTP API testing with seamless Jest integration
- **In-memory data:** Chosen for simplicity and fast test execution
- **No external database:** Keeps tests isolated and fast

## Assumptions
- API runs on localhost:8080 during testing
- Test data is reset before each test
- No authentication required for this implementation
- Focus on functional testing over performance testing
